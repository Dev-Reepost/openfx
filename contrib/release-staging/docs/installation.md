# Installation

AIFX ships as a set of OpenFX plugin bundles (`.ofx.bundle` directories).
Any application implementing the OpenFX 1.4 standard or later will discover and
load them from the standard plugin directory for your operating system.

This page covers installing the plugins. The companion document
[ComfyUI server setup](comfyui-server-setup.md) covers the model server side,
which is required for the plugins to do useful work.

## Standard OpenFX plugin directories

| OS | System-wide | Per-user |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | `/Library/OFX/Plugins` | `~/Library/OFX/Plugins` |
| **Linux** | `/usr/OFX/Plugins` | `~/OFX/Plugins` |
| **Windows** | `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\OFX\Plugins` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OFX\Plugins` |

The host application reads from these directories at startup. Restart the host
after installing or updating plugins.

## Installing prebuilt bundles

> Prebuilt binaries are not yet published. Until V1.0.0 is tagged, install
> from source — see below.

When prebuilt bundles are available, the install procedure is:

1. Download the archive for your OS from the
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/{{ORG}}/AIFX/releases) page.
2. Extract the `*.ofx.bundle` directories.
3. Move each `.ofx.bundle` into one of the plugin directories from the table
   above. Use the system-wide directory if all users on the machine should see
   the plugins, or the per-user directory otherwise.
4. Restart your host application.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

- **CMake 3.28** or later
- **Conan 2.1** or later
- A C++17 compiler:
  - macOS: Xcode command line tools (Apple Clang)
  - Linux: GCC 10+ or Clang 12+
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload
- **Git**

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ORG}}/AIFX.git
cd AIFX

# Build and install all plugins to the per-user OFX directory:
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/depth_da3 --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/normal_crafter --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/depth_crafter --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/segmentation_sam3 --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/matte_mama --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/matte_ma2 --install
./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/upscale_seedvr2 --install
```

The `--install` flag copies the resulting `.ofx.bundle` into your per-user OFX
plugin directory. Without it, the bundle is left under `build/Release/`.

For a system-wide install, run with elevated privileges and pass an explicit
install path:

```bash
sudo ./tools/build-plugin.sh plugins/depth_da3 --install \
  --install-dir /Library/OFX/Plugins
```

### Build options

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-d`, `--debug` | Debug build (slower, larger, with symbols). |
| `-c`, `--clean` | Wipe `build/` first for a clean rebuild. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Verbose CMake / build output. |
| `--bundle-name "Name"` | Override the bundle directory name. |
| `--install` | Copy the built bundle to the OFX plugin directory. |
| `--install-dir <path>` | Override the install destination. |

### Universal binaries on macOS

The build defaults to a universal binary (arm64 + x86_64). To build for the
host architecture only, pass `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64` (or `x86_64`)
to CMake.

## Verifying the install

1. Restart your OFX host.
2. Open the effect / filter browser.
3. Look under the **AIFX** category.
4. Apply one of the plugins to a clip and check that the parameters panel
   appears.

If the plugins do not appear:

- Confirm the `.ofx.bundle` directories are inside one of the standard
  plugin paths from the table above (not nested in a subdirectory).
- Confirm the bundle structure is intact: each `.ofx.bundle` must contain a
  `Contents/<arch>/` directory with the `.ofx` shared library.
- Check the host's OFX plugin loading log if it has one.
- See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

The plugin will appear in the host even when no ComfyUI server is running. The
plugin only fails when you actually invoke a render. Set up the server side
next: [ComfyUI server setup](comfyui-server-setup.md).
