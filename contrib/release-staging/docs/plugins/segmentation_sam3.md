# SAM3 Segmentation (`segmentation_sam3`)

**Sequence · Text/click-prompted mask propagation**

Segment objects in a clip from a text prompt or click, with the mask propagated
through the entire sequence. Built on Meta's Segment Anything Model 3.

## What you give it

- An RGB clip.
- A **text prompt** ("yellow school bus", "person in foreground"), an
  **image exemplar**, or a **click / box** on a frame.

## What you get back

- A per-frame alpha mask propagated across the clip.

Typical VFX use: rapid rotoscoping for sky replacement, character isolation,
garbage matte generation, or driving a secondary color grade — work that
previously required frame-by-frame manual roto.

## Commercial use

| Component | License | Commercial OK? |
|---|---|---|
| SAM3 code (Meta) | SAM License | ✅ With conditions |
| SAM3 weights | SAM License | ✅ With conditions |

The SAM License permits commercial use (non-exclusive, royalty-free) but
**prohibits use in military, weapons, ITAR/export-controlled, nuclear, and
surveillance applications**. Redistribution must keep the SAM License notice
attached. Acknowledgement is required in any publication using SAM materials.

## Requirements

- **GPU VRAM:** ~4 GB minimum for inference; 16 GB consumer GPU comfortable
  for HD work; 24 GB+ for 4K end-to-end. Multi-object real-time video targets
  H100/H200-class GPUs.
- **ComfyUI custom node:** [PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-SAM3) (alternative: [yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Sam3](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Sam3)).
- **Model weights:** [facebook/sam3](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3) — single ~3.4 GB checkpoint. **Gated** — run `hf auth login` and accept terms before downloading.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Text Prompt** | Open-vocabulary noun phrase that selects the subject. More specific = better. |
| **Frame Index** | 0-based index within the loaded sequence (not the timeline frame). The frame on which the prompt is evaluated. |
| **Score Threshold** | Confidence threshold for accepting detections. Lower (e.g. 0.2) finds more; higher (e.g. 0.5) restricts to high-confidence matches. |
| **Direction** | `forward`, `backward`, or `both`. Use `both` if the subject enters or exits the frame mid-clip. |
| **Object ID** | Which detected instance to extract when multiple are returned. |
| **Plot All Masks** | Show all detected instances vs. just the chosen object. |
| **Image Load Cap** | Maximum frames in one ComfyUI propagation pass. |

Plus the standard ComfyUI base parameters.

## Performance

- ~30 ms per image (H200, 100+ objects).
- SAM 3.1 reaches ~32 FPS on H100 for medium-object-count video.
- Latency scales with object count.

## Limitations

- **Long occlusion:** SAM 3 can lose track when an object is occluded for many
  frames and may fail to recover when it reappears.
- **Identity swaps:** between visually similar instances, especially when they
  cross paths.
- **Boundary drift:** under slow lighting changes or low-contrast edges.
- **Motion blur:** can hallucinate false positives under fast motion.
- **Small / thin objects:** weak (hair strands, fences, antennae).
- **Dense overlapping instances:** crowd scenes degrade significantly.
- Reported video accuracy is meaningfully below image accuracy (cgF1 30.3%
  video vs. 54.1% image on SA-Co benchmark) — propagation through time is
  harder than single-frame segmentation.

For high-quality alpha mattes (hair, soft edges, smoke), feed the SAM 3 mask
into [`matte_mama`](matte_mama.md) or [`matte_ma2`](matte_ma2.md) as a seed.
